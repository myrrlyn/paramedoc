## Licensing

This repository contains two works:

1. Paramedoc Language Specification: this is licensed under the CC-BY-SA-4.0
   license. The *text of this specification* may be used or altered, **but**
   users must disclose (a) this source repository and (b) their alterations.
   These requirements allow you to extend the language while keeping clarity as
   to what exists here in the original source vs what is your extension.
2. A reference implementation program: this is licensed under Apache 2.0. This
   program may be used freely in your software to process Paramedoc text without
   any other obligations.
